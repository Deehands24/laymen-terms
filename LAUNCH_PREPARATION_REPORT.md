### 2. Stripe Integration Implementation
- **Checkout API**: Created `/api/create-checkout-session` endpoint
- **Payment Processing**: Full Stripe checkout integration with session management
- **Webhook Handling**: Enhanced webhook processing for subscription lifecycle
- **Success/Cancel Handling**: Added proper redirect and message handling

### 3. Database Schema Compatibility

```

### Payment Flow
```
1. User clicks "Subscribe" on paid plan
2. System creates Stripe checkout session
3. User redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout
4. Webhook processes successful payment
5. Subscription activated with monthly reset
```

### Database Updates
- Enhanced `user_subscriptions` table handling
- Support for both legacy and new schema fields
- Monthly usage tracking with period management
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
