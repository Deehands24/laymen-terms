  - Add standard `name="email"` attribute
  - Include `type="email"` for email fields
  - Ensure consistent field naming

### 2. **Translation Functionality**

- **Solutions:**
  - Add clear search/translation input fields
  - Include proper field identifiers (name, id, placeholder)
  - Make translation feature more prominent

### 3. **User Experience**
- **Issue:** Navigation and functionality unclear
- **Solutions:**
  - Add clear navigation labels
  - Implement proper form validation
  - Provide user feedback for actions
